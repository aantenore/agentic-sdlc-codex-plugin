# Self-service CLI

The command line starts with the answer a person needs, even when they do not
know the plugin's internal model. Human output always explains:

1. what happened;
2. what changes in practice;
3. whether you need to decide anything;
4. what remains protected;
5. the next useful step.

Record IDs, stored policy labels, paths, hashes, and diagnostic codes appear
after **Technical details (optional)**. JSON retains those fields for
automation.

Codex plugin installation does not create a global `agentic-sdlc` executable.
In the examples below, that name is shorthand for the installer-managed entry
point:

```bash
PLUGIN_CLI="$HOME/plugins/agentic-sdlc-codex-plugin/bin/agentic-sdlc.mjs"
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" help
```

An npm installation may expose the same CLI through its npm bin shim. To test
the exact Codex cache instead, derive the version and cache root as shown in
[Portable Installation](portable-install.md#verify-the-exact-build-not-only-the-version).

## Find the right command

Focused help works outside an initialized project and follows the command
hierarchy:

```bash
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" help
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" help autonomy
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" help autonomy delivery
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" help autonomy delivery approve --locale it
```

Use `status` when you only want to know what needs attention now:

```bash
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" status
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" status --locale it
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" status --json
```

The human view gives one recommended next action. The JSON view preserves the
existing project and count fields, adds `schema_version: cli-status:v1`, and
includes the same summary and next action in a stable machine-readable shape.

## Choose presentation without changing authority

Built-in presets change only language and presentation:

```bash
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" preset list
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" preset show human-it
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" status --cli-preset human-it
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" status --cli-preset machine
```

The built-ins are `human-en`, `human-it`, `machine`, `diagnostic`, and
`no-browser`. Explicit command options win over preset values.

A preset cannot choose a command, approve work, widen a path, select a target,
or add an execution flag. Import rejects every option outside the presentation
allowlist before accessing project state. This keeps a shared preset from
quietly changing what the plugin is allowed to do.

Export is deterministic, so the same preset produces byte-identical JSON:

```bash
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" preset export human-it
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" preset export human-it > human-it.json
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" status --cli-preset @human-it.json
```

The exported file is directly reimportable. Import validates its schema and
presentation-only allowlist before reading project state.

## Enable shell completion

Completion generation is deterministic and does not evaluate project files:

```bash
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" completion bash
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" completion zsh
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" completion fish
node "$PLUGIN_CLI" completion powershell
```

Load or install the printed script using the normal completion mechanism for
your shell. Regenerate it after upgrading if the command catalog changes.

## Understand an autonomy answer

The primary message uses ordinary language. For example, it says that the
requirement defines the most freedom a future change may request, while every
pull request or local release still receives its own separate choice. If the
current installation can only record who approved the work, it explains that
the agent must stop at the named checkpoints unless a trusted host supplies a
signed approval for that exact delivery.

Only the optional technical section names stored values such as
`bounded-autonomous`, `audit_only`, the delivery-profile ID, or receipt paths.
Those values remain available for audit and automation without making them a
prerequisite for understanding the decision.

## Install or update locally

The local installer uses a reviewable transaction:

```bash
python3 scripts/install-personal-marketplace-v2.py check --locale it
python3 scripts/install-personal-marketplace-v2.py plan --locale it --json
python3 scripts/install-personal-marketplace-v2.py apply --locale it --plan-hash <plan_hash-from-plan> --json
# Required: execute candidate_registration.command.argv with its exact
# command.environment, then verification.argv with verification.environment.
# Default target example only; never use it for a custom returned target:
env HOME="$HOME" CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex" codex plugin add agentic-sdlc-codex-plugin@personal --json
env HOME="$HOME" CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex" codex plugin list --json
python3 scripts/install-personal-marketplace-v2.py validate --locale it --transaction-id <transaction_id-from-apply> --receipt-hash <receipt_hash-from-apply>
python3 scripts/install-personal-marketplace-v2.py confirm --locale it --transaction-id <transaction_id-from-apply> --receipt-hash <receipt_hash-from-apply>
python3 scripts/autoconfigure-token-efficiency.py apply --json
```

V2 is the canonical local installer. `check` and `plan` never write. With no
command, it also creates a plan only. `apply` accepts one exact plan hash,
recalculates it under a lock, stages and byte-verifies the package, and retains
the prior plugin plus marketplace bytes. `validate` proves the installed state
still matches the receipt. Refresh and inspect the official Codex copy before
`confirm`: confirmation verifies that candidate list/cache before removing
recovery data. The returned `restore` command instead restores the byte-exact
previous local and Codex state. Unexpected data stops recovery without being
overwritten. Use `--home /absolute/path` to inspect or manage another explicit
destination. The two `env ... codex` lines above are only a default-target
illustration. When `--home`, `--codex-home`, or `--codex-executable` selects a
non-default target, do not execute those lines and do not reconstruct a bare
`codex plugin add` command. Execute exclusively
`technical_details.candidate_registration.command.argv` with its exact
`environment`, followed by `candidate_registration.verification.argv` with its
exact `environment`, before `validate`.

V2 never changes global settings. After it is confirmed, the separate
token-efficiency command verifies bundled Caveman and native-meter files, then
configures an existing RTK binary through a private copy whose bytes match the
verified executable. It does not download/upgrade RTK, configure CodeBurn, use
the network, or authenticate. This step changes the current user's global Codex
instructions for every project; it is intentionally outside V2's
retained-backup boundary.
See [Portable install](portable-install.md) for supported environments, trust
boundaries, removal, and recovery.
